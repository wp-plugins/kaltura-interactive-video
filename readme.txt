== Description ==
Important notice - Kaltura will not be releasing any new versions of the Interactive Video Plugin, but don’t worry, you can download the new and improved Kaltura All in One Video Pack for WordPress - http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-video-pack/

Migrating to the new plugin - it is VERY EASY to upgrade to the All in One Video Pack and still keep all of your existing content and video posts. 

Here is what you need to do:
- Download and install the “All in One Video Pack” plugin http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-video-pack/
- Deactivate the “Interactive Video” plugin (they cannot both be active at the same time)
- Activating the new plugin will automatically assign it to your Kaltura Partner ID (no additional signup required) and your content will be displayed in the wp-admin panel.


What about old players?
They will continue to function. New posts will be created with the new players that come with the current release.

Creative potential, innovation, and competition all correlate directly with the balance of freedoms and constraints we face in sharing, manipulating, finding, and watching video. For instance, to create remixes or mash-ups, video artists need access to the original materials in order to reformulate their new work. In an ideal world, everyday users will be able to easily copy and paste portions of video, as they already can with text. Of course the benefits of a more open system will go far beyond remixing, cutting, and pasting — when open video standards and formats are widely embraced, it will be possible to index, search, and access the medium much as we do text. This will be the real revolution for video.
